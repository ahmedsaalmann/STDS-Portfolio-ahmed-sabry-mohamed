# Reflection: Employee Performance Analysis Project

## 1. What I learned:
- I learned how to perform data joins between different tables (Employees, Departments, etc.) using keys like EmployeeID to create a comprehensive dataset.
- I gained insights into analyzing the relationship between "Score After Training" and actual employee performance trends.
- I learned how to transform raw text data from CSV files into interactive visualizations in Tableau to identify general trends.

## 2. What was challenging:
- Handling different date formats between the attendance records and performance evaluations was tricky to ensure accurate time-series analysis.
- Identifying the most impactful metrics (KPIs) was challenging, given the variety of data points like training duration and attendance status.

## 3. What I improved from previous tasks:
- I improved my data cleaning skills prior to analysis, which significantly reduced errors in the final results compared to my previous projects.
- My dashboard design has become more user-centric and simplified, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) rather than overcomplicating the view with unnecessary data.
