1. What I learned
"I learned the importance of data cleaning by transforming 'Raw Data' into 'Clean Data' to ensure accuracy. I also learned how to use Pivot Tables to aggregate sales figures and built a dynamic Dashboard to visualize key performance indicators for the Egyptian market."

2. What was challenging
"Identifying and fixing inconsistencies in the raw dataset was challenging, as it required careful attention to detail. Additionally, choosing the most appropriate chart types for the dashboard to represent the data clearly took some time and experimentation."

3. What I improved from previous tasks
"As this is the first task, I focused on establishing a solid workflow for data analysis. I improved my ability to apply theoretical concepts from lectures into a practical Excel project and learned how to structure my repository for the portfolio."
