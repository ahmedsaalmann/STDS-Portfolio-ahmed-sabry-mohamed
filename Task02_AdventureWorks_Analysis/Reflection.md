1.
What I learned 
"I learned how to write complex SQL queries using JOINs to combine data from multiple tables (SalesOrderHeader, SalesOrderDetail). I also learned how to use Pivot Tables in Excel to summarize large datasets and create interactive Dashboards to visualize sales trends over time."

2.
What was challenging 
"Understanding the relationships between the database tables (Primary Keys and Foreign Keys) was initially challenging. Also, dealing with data types and formatting the charts in Excel to make them look professional required some trial and error."

3.
What I improved from previous tasks 
"Compared to the previous task, I improved my documentation skills by adding comments to my SQL code. I also focused more on the visual presentation of the data in the dashboard to make it easier for the user to understand."
