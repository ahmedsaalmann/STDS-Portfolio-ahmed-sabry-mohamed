1. What I learned
"I learned how to use Microsoft Power BI for end-to-end data analysis. I practiced importing data from multiple sources (Employees, Attendance, Performance tables), creating a data model with proper relationships (Star Schema), and building interactive visualizations to track HR KPIs."

2. What was challenging
"Managing the relationships between the fact tables (such as Attendance and Performance Evaluations) and dimension tables (Employees and Calendar) was complex. Additionally, creating calculated measures to accurately analyze attendance rates and training completion percentages required careful logic."

3. What I improved from previous tasks
"Building on my previous Excel and SQL tasks, I advanced to using a specialized BI tool (Power BI). I improved my data storytelling skills by creating a fully interactive and automated dashboard, moving beyond the static charts used in previous assignments."
